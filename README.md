# Ethics in Technology

I created this website as a means of cataloging my thoughts around ethics in software.
This is by no means complete and probably never will be.

I want this or something like this, to spark discussions in our industry about ethics.
It struck me that medical professionals have the hippocratic oath, so why don't we have something simillar?

There are logical concerns out there about if or how we enforce this, how do we administer it?
What happens when our company asks us to violate it? Is this a precursor to a union or industry organisation?

I don't know. This repo is not aimed at answering those questions, though I do think that they are questions that we need to answer.

If you have questions or concerns, or any other feedback feel free to open an issue. If you think this should be changed, you're welcome to submit a pull request.
If you can't or don't want to do github related things, you can contact me on twitter - @4lexnz

Cheers
