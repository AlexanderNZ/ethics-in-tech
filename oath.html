        <li>I swear to fulfill to the best of my abilities, this oath.
            I do so because I should, and because I must, for the betterment of the humans I share this planet with.
        </li>
        <li>I will respect the efforts of those that came before me. I will respect the technology they created, and
            that I rely on, for truly do I stand on the shoulders of giants.
        </li>
        <li>I will apply, for the benefit of those in need, all of my skill and knowledge, and I will not hold those
            less skilled in contempt.
        </li>
        <li>I will remember that in technology there is beauty as well as function, and that our humanity must always
            outweigh our technology.
        </li>
        <li>The sum of our knowledge is larger then any one of us could know. I will not feel shamed that I do not or
            can not know everything. I pledge to always remain humble, and to say "I do not know". I will never hesitate
            in calling on my colleagues when the skills of another are needed to solve our problems.
        </li>
        <li>I will respect the privacy of our users. I will respect their right to choose with the fullest knowledge
            they need to make the best choice they can, and I will under no circumstances contribute to projects that
            undermine the human rights we all, as humans enjoy.
        </li>
        <li>I will remember that I do not create only for the joy of creating. I create to do good, to achieve our
            goals, and to advance us as a cohesive whole. I create to share, and to learn and to be happy. But most of
            all I create to solve problems.
        </li>
        <li>I will remember that my own perception of the problem may be flawed. It is my responsibility to consult my
            users, to seek out and respond to the feedback they provide if I am to successfully solve their problem.
        </li>
        <li>I will prevent the misuse of technology where ever I can, and will always encourage inclusiveness.</li>
        <li>I will remember that I am part of a greater whole, with obligation to society commensurate with my ability
            to affect change in that society. This obligation extends to all members of society, both the included and
            excluded, the self and the others.
        </li>
        <li>If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with
            affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long
            experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.
        </li>
    </ol>
