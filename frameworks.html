                    <p class="lead"><b>The Utilitarian Approach</b></p>
                    <p>Bases the ethical and moral correctness of an action on the amount of happiness or sadness it
                        induces in those it affects. Utilitarianism is one of the most commen approaches to makeing
                        ethical decisions, especially where those decisions affect a large amount of people. It marks
                        the best action as one that provides the greatest balance of good over harm.</p>

                    <p class="lead"><b>The Common Good Approach</b></p>
                    <p>The Common Good argument is that the best society should be guided by the “general will” of the
                        people which would then produce what is best for the people as a whole. This approach to ethics
                        underscores the networked aspects of society and emphasizes respect and compassion for others,
                        especially those who are more vulnerable.</p>

                    <p class="lead"><b>The Duty Based Approach</b></p>
                    <p>The duty based approach emphasises the importance of personal will and intention to ethical
                        decision making. The ethical action is one taken from duty, that is, it is done precisely
                        because it is our obligation to perform the action. The most basic form of the imperative is:
                        “Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a
                        universal law.” So, for example, lying is unethical because we could not universalize a maxim
                        that said “One should always lie.” Such a maxim would render all speech meaningless. We can,
                        however, universalize the maxim, “Always speak truthfully,” without running into a logical
                        contradiction.</p>

                    <p class="lead"><b>The Rights Approach</b></p>
                    <p>The Rights approach to ethics stipulates that the best ethical action is that which protects the
                        ethical rights of those who are affected by the action. It emphasizes the belief that all humans
                        have a right to dignity. This is based on a formulation of Kant’s categorical imperative that
                        says: “Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of
                        another, always at the same time as an end and never simply as a means to an end.”</p>

                    <p class="lead"><b>The Fairness or Justice Approach</b></p>
                    <p>Aristotle and other Greek philosophers have contributed the idea that all equals should be
                        treated equally. Today we use this idea to say that ethical actions treat all human beings
                        equally-or if unequally, then fairly based on some standard that is defensible. We pay people
                        more based on their harder work or the greater amount that they contribute to an organization,
                        and say that is fair. But there is a debate over CEO salaries that are hundreds of times larger
                        than the pay of others; many ask whether the huge disparity is based on a defensible standard or
                        whether it is the result of an imbalance of power and hence is unfair.</p>

                    <p class="lead"><b>The Virtue Approach</b></p>
                    <p>A very ancient approach to ethics is that ethical actions ought to be consistent with certain
                        ideal virtues that provide for the full development of our humanity. These virtues are
                        dispositions and habits that enable us to act according to the highest potential of our
                        character and on behalf of values like truth and beauty. Honesty, courage, compassion,
                        generosity, tolerance, love, fidelity, integrity, fairness, self-control, and prudence are all
                        examples of virtues. Virtue ethics asks of any action, "What kind of person will I become if I
                        do this?" or "Is this action consistent with my acting at my best?" </p>

                    <p class="lead"><b>The Feminist Approach</b></p>
                    <p>In recent decades, the virtue approach to ethics has been supplemented and sometimes
                        significantly revised by thinkers in the feminist tradition, who often emphasize the importance
                        of the experiences of women and other marginalized groups to ethical deliberation. Among the
                        most important contributions of this approach is its foregrounding of the principle of care as a
                        legitimately primary ethical concern, often in opposition to the seemingly cold and impersonal
                        justice approach. Like virtue ethics, feminist ethics concerned with the totality of human life
                        and how this life comes to influence the way we make ethical decisions.</p>

                <p class="lead"><b>The Utilitarian Approach</b></p>
                <p>Utilitarianism can be traced back to the school of the Ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus of Samos
                    (341-270 BCE), who argued that the best life is one that produces the least pain and distress. The
                    18th Century British philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) applied a similar standard to individual
                    actions, and created a system in which actions could be described as good or bad depending upon the
                    amount and degree of pleasure and/or pain they would produce. Bentham’s student, John Stuart Mill
                    (1806-1873) modified this system by making its standard for the good the more subjective concept of
                    “happiness,” as opposed to the more materialist idea of “pleasure.”</p>

                <p>Utilitarianism is one of the most common approaches to making ethical decisions, especially decisions
                    with consequences that concern large groups of people, in part because it instructs us to weigh the
                    different amounts of good and bad that will be produced by our action. This conforms to our feeling
                    that some good and some bad will necessarily be the result of our action and that the best action
                    will be that which provides the most good or does the least harm, or, to put it another way,
                    produces the greatest balance of good over harm. Ethical environmental action, then, is the one that
                    produces the greatest good and does the least harm for all who are affected—government,
                    corporations, the community, and the environment.</p>

                <p class="lead"><b>The Egoistic Approach</b></p>
                <p>One variation of the utilitarian approach is known as ethical egoism, or the ethics of self-
                    interest. In this approach, an individual often uses utilitarian calculation to produce the greatest
                    amount of good for him or herself. Ancient Greek Sophists like Thrasymacus (c. 459-400 BCE), who
                    famously claimed that might makes right, and early modern thinkers like Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679)
                    may be considered forerunners of this approach. One of the most influential recent proponents of
                    ethical egoism was the Russian-American philosopher Ayn Rand (1905-1982), who, in the book The
                    Virtue of Selfishness (1964), argues that self-interest is a prerequisite to self-respect and to
                    respect for others. There are numerous parallels between ethical egoism and laissez-faire economic
                    theories, in which the pursuit of self-interest is seen as leading to the benefit of society,
                    although the benefit of society is seen only as the fortunate byproduct of following individual
                    self-interest, not its goal.</p>

                <p class="lead"><b>The Common Good Approach</b></p>
                <p>The ancient Greek philosophers Plato (427-347 BCE) and Aristotle (384-322 BCE) promoted the
                    perspective that our actions should contribute to ethical communal life life. The most influential
                    modern proponent of this approach was the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), who
                    argued that the best society should be guided by the “general will” of the people which would then
                    produce what is best for the people as a whole. This approach to ethics underscores the networked
                    aspects of society and emphasizes respect and compassion for others, especially those who are more
                    vulnerable.</p>

                <p class="lead"><b>The Duty-Based Approach</b></p>
                <p>The duty-based approach, sometimes called deontological ethics, is most commonly associated with the
                    philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804), although it had important precursors in earlier
                    non-consquentialist, often explicitly religious, thinking of people like Saint Augustine of Hippo
                    (354-430), who emphasized the importance of the personal will and intention (and of the omnipotent
                    God who sees this interior mental state) to ethical decision making. Kant argued that doing what is
                    right is not about the consequences of our actions (something over which we ultimately have no
                    control) but about having the proper intention in performing the action. The ethical action is one
                    taken from duty, that is, it is done precisely because it is our obligation to perform the action.
                    Ethical obligations are the same for all rational creatures (they are universal), and knowledge of
                    what these obligations entail is arrived at by discovering rules of behavior that are not
                    contradicted by reason.</p>

                <p>Kant’s famous formula for discovering our ethical duty is known as the “categorical imperative.” It
                    has a number of different versions, but Kant believed they all amounted to the same imperative. The
                    most basic form of the imperative is: “Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same
                    time will that it should become a universal law.” So, for example, lying is unethical because we
                    could not universalize a maxim that said “One should always lie.” Such a maxim would render all
                    speech meaningless. We can, however, universalize the maxim, “Always speak truthfully,” without
                    running into a logical contradiction. (Notice the duty-based approach says nothing about how easy or
                    difficult it would be to carry out these maxims, only that it is our duty as rational creatures to
                    do so.) In acting according to a law that we have discovered to be rational according to our own
                    universal reason, we are acting autonomously (in a self-regulating fashion), and thus are bound by
                    duty, a duty we have given ourselves as rational creatures. We thus freely choose (we will) to bind
                    ourselves to the moral law. For Kant, choosing to obey the universal moral law is the very nature of
                    acting ethically.</p>

                <p class="lead"><b>The Rights Approach</b></p>
                <p>The Rights approach to ethics is another non-consequentialist approach which derives much of its
                    current force from Kantian duty-based ethics, although it also has a history that dates back at
                    least to the Stoics of Ancient Greece and Rome, and has another influential current which flows from
                    work of the British empiricist philosopher John Locke (1632-1704). This approach stipulates that the
                    best ethical action is that which protects the ethical rights of those who are affected by the
                    action. It emphasizes the belief that all humans have a right to dignity. This is based on a
                    formulation of Kant’s categorical imperative that says: “Act in such a way that you treat humanity,
                    whether in your own person or in the person of another, always at the same time as an end and never
                    simply as a means to an end.” The list of ethical rights is debated; many now argue that animals and
                    other non-humans such as robots also have rights.</p>

                <p class="lead"><b>The Fairness or Justice Approach</b></p>
                <p>The Law Code of Hammurabi in Ancient Mesopotamia (c. 1750 BCE) held that all free men should be
                    treated alike, just as all slaves should be treated alike. When combined with the universality of
                    the rights approach, the justice approach can be applied to all human persons. The most influential
                    version of this approach today is found in the work of American philosopher John Rawls (1921-2002),
                    who argued, along Kantian lines, that just ethical principles are those that would be chosen by free
                    and rational people in an initial situation of equality. This hypothetical contract is considered
                    fair or just because it provides a procedure for what counts as a fair action, and does not concern
                    itself with the consequences of those actions. Fairness of starting point is the principle for what
                    is considered just.</p>

                <p class="lead"><b>The Divine Command Approach</b></p>
                <p>As its name suggests, this approach sees what is right as the same as what God commands, and ethical
                    standards are the creation of God’s will. Following God’s will is seen as the very definition what
                    is ethical. Because God is seen as omnipotent and possessed of free will, God could change what is
                    now considered ethical, and God is not bound by any standard of right or wrong short of logical
                    contradiction. The Medieval Christian philosopher William of Ockham (1285-1349) was one of the most
                    influential thinkers in this tradition, and his writings served as a guide for Protestant Reformers
                    like Martin Luther (1483-1546) and Jean Calvin (1509-1564). The Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard
                    (1813-1855), in praising the biblical Patriarch Abraham’s willingness to kill his son Isaac at God’s
                    command, claimed that truly right action must ultimately go beyond everyday morality to what he
                    called the “teleological suspension of the ethical,” again demonstrating the somewhat tenuous
                    relationship between religion and ethics mentioned earlier.</p>

                <p class="lead"><b>The Virtue Approach</b></p>
                <p>One long-standing ethical principle argues that ethical actions should be consistent with ideal human
                    virtues. Aristotle, for example, argued that ethics should be concerned with the whole of a person’s
                    life, not with the individual discrete actions a person may perform in any given situation. A person
                    of good character would be one who has attainted certain virtues. This approach is also prominent in
                    non-Western contexts, especially in East Asia, where the tradition of the Chinese sage Confucius
                    (551-479 BCE) emphasizes the importance of acting virtuously (in an appropriate manner) in a variety
                    of situations. Because virtue ethics is concerned with the entirety of a person’s life, it takes the
                    process of education and training seriously, and emphasizes the importance of role models to our
                    understanding of how to engage in ethical deliberation.</p>

                <p class="lead"><b>The Feminist Approach</b></p>
                <p>In recent decades, the virtue approach to ethics has been supplemented and sometimes significantly
                    revised by thinkers in the feminist tradition, who often emphasize the importance of the experiences
                    of women and other marginalized groups to ethical deliberation. Among the most important
                    contributions of this approach is its foregrounding of the principle of care as a legitimately
                    primary ethical concern, often in opposition to the seemingly cold and impersonal justice approach.
                    Like virtue ethics, feminist ethics concerned with the totality of human life and how this life
                    comes to influence the way we make ethical decisions.</p>
